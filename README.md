# Loan
Milestone 2 Project

In this project, I used the loan approval dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset/).

Using Machine Learning's Classification method, I used the dataset to try and predict whether an applicant gets aapproved or rejected.

Libraries used for this project include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- feature_engine
- scikit-learn
